## Approach
This module builds on the learner's experience with unit and integration testing with JUnit. We introduce the concept of using mock objects to remove external dependencies in automated tests. We demonstrate how to use the Mockito framework to create simple testing scenarios with mock objects using the Record Collection project. The lesson material implements part of the test suite and learners are then tasked with completing the remaining tests.
